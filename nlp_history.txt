For other uses see NLP This article is about natural language processing done by computers For the natural language processing done by the human brain see Language processing in the brain Illustration of the field by a brain and a microchip interacting via language knowledge representation signal processing programming etc Natural language processing NLP is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language It involves processing natural language datasets such as text corpora or speech corpora using either rulebased or probabilistic ie statistical and most recently neural networkbased machine learning approaches The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents including the contextual nuances of the language within them The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition naturallanguage understanding and naturallanguage generation History Further information History of natural language processing Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s Already in 1950 Alan Turing published an article titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language Symbolic NLP 1950s early 1990s The premise of symbolic NLP is wellsummarized by John Searles Chinese room experiment Given a collection of rules eg a Chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other NLP tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English The authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem However real progress was much slower and after the ALPAC report in 1966 which found that tenyearlong research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America though some research continued elsewhere such as Japan and Europe until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and ELIZA a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 Using almost no information about human thought or emotion ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly humanlike interaction When the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base ELIZA might provide a generic response for example responding to My head hurts with Why do you say your head hurts Ross Quillians successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time 1970s During the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured realworld information into computerunderstandable data Examples are MARGIE Schank 1975 SAM Cullingford 1978 PAM Wilensky 1978 TaleSpin Meehan 1976 QUALM Lehnert 1977 Politics Carbonell 1979 and Plot Units Lehnert 1981 During this time the first chatterbots were written eg PARRY 1980s The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP Focus areas of the time included research on rulebased parsing eg the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology eg twolevel morphology semantics eg Lesk algorithm reference eg within Centering Theory and other areas of natural language understanding eg in the Rhetorical Structure Theory Other lines of research were continued eg the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky An important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period Statistical NLP 1990s2010s Up to the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules Starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing This was due to both the steady increase in computational power see Moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics eg transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing 1990s Many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at IBM Research such as IBM alignment models These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government However most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems As a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s With the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data has become available since the mid1990s Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semisupervised learning algorithms Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been handannotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and nonannotated data Generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data However there is an enormous amount of nonannotated data available including among other things the entire content of the World Wide Web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical Neural NLP present In 2003 word ngram model at the time the best statistical algorithm was overperformed by a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling by Yoshua Bengio with coauthors In 2010 Tomáš Mikolov then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology with coauthors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling and in the following years he went on to develop Wordvec In the 2010s representation learning and deep neural networkstyle featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve stateoftheart results in many natural language tasks eg in language modeling and parsing This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care or protect patient privacy In 2023 Gautam Siwach a PhD student at University of New Haven with coauthor Dr Cheryl Li introduce an inventive approach to augment HumanCobot Interaction HCI through the incorporation of Natural Language Processing NLP The research integrates the CoboVox voice recognition system into the URe cobot interface enabling seamless voiceactivated engagement for efficient communication The methodology involves constructing a comprehensive vocabulary scrutinizing NLP models and selecting the most fitting one for practical implementation The resulting HCI framework facilitates the interpretation of voice commands empowering even nonexpert robot operators to effortlessly program and control cobots This study signifies a notable advancement in the field emphasizing the transformative role of NLP in bridging the communication gap between humans and collaborative robots Approaches Symbolic statistical neural networks Symbolic approach ie the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming Machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the rulebased approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar eg containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input eg with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the rulebased systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to rulebased systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems Although rulebased systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023 Before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods eg for the machine translation of lowresource languages such as provided by the Apertium system for preprocessing in NLP pipelines eg tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines eg for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses Statistical approach In the late 1980s and mid1990s the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches The earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches Only the introduction of hidden Markov models applied to partofspeech tagging announced the end of the old rulebased approach Neural networks Further information Artificial neural network A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering Since 2015 the statistical approach was replaced by neural networks approach using word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words Intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing have not been needed anymore Neural machine translation based on thennewlyinvented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation Common NLP tasks The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing Some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience A coarse division is given below Text and speech processing Optical character recognition OCR Given an image representing printed text determine the corresponding text Speech recognition Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking determine the textual representation of the speech This is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed AIcomplete see above In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition see below In most spoken languages the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process Also given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent Speech segmentation Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking separate it into words A subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it Texttospeech Given a text transform those units and produce a spoken representation Texttospeech can be used to aid the visually impaired Word segmentation Tokenization Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words For a language like English this is fairly trivial since words are usually separated by spaces However some written languages like Chinese Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language Sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words BOW creation in data mining Morphological analysis Lemmatization The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma Lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form But in this case the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form Morphological segmentation Separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology ie the structure of words of the language being considered English has fairly simple morphology especially inflectional morphology and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word eg open opens opened opening as separate words In languages such as Turkish or Meitei a highly agglutinated Indian language however such an approach is not possible as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms Partofspeech tagging Given a sentence determine the part of speech POS for each word Many words especially common ones can serve as multiple parts of speech For example book can be a noun the book on the table or verb to book a flight set can be a noun verb or adjective and out can be any of at least five different parts of speech Stemming The process of reducing inflected or sometimes derived words to a base form eg close will be the root for closed closing close closer etc Stemming yields similar results as lemmatization but does so on grounds of rules not a dictionary Syntactic analysis Grammar induction Generate a formal grammar that describes a languages syntax Sentence breaking also known as sentence boundary disambiguation Given a chunk of text find the sentence boundaries Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks but these same characters can serve other purposes eg marking abbreviations Parsing Determine the parse tree grammatical analysis of a given sentence The grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses perhaps surprisingly for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human There are two primary types of parsing dependency parsing and constituency parsing Dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence marking things like primary objects and predicates whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic contextfree grammar PCFG see also stochastic grammar Lexical semantics of individual words in context Lexical semantics What is the computational meaning of individual words in context Distributional semantics How can we learn semantic representations from data Named entity recognition NER Given a stream of text determine which items in the text map to proper names such as people or places and what the type of each such name is eg person location organization Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient For example the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized and named entities often span several words only some of which are capitalized Furthermore many other languages in nonWestern scripts eg Chinese or Arabic do not have any capitalization at all and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names For example German capitalizes all nouns regardless of whether they are names and French and Spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives Another name for this task is token classification Sentiment analysis see also Multimodal sentiment analysis Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents often using online reviews to determine polarity about specific objects It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in social media for marketing Terminology extraction The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus Wordsense disambiguation WSD Many words have more than one meaning we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context For this problem we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses eg from a dictionary or an online resource such as WordNet Entity linking Many wordstypically proper namesrefer to named entities here we have to select the entity a famous individual a location a company etc which is referred to in context Relational semantics semantics of individual sentences Relationship extraction Given a chunk of text identify the relationships among named entities eg who is married to whom Semantic parsing Given a piece of text typically a sentence produce a formal representation of its semantics either as a graph eg in AMR parsing or in accordance with a logical formalism eg in DRT parsing This challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary NLP tasks from semantics eg semantic role labelling wordsense disambiguation and can be extended to include fullfledged discourse analysis eg discourse analysis coreference see Natural language understanding below Semantic role labelling see also implicit semantic role labelling below Given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates eg verbal frames then identify and classify the frame elements semantic roles Discourse semantics beyond individual sentences Coreference resolution Given a sentence or larger chunk of text determine which words mentions refer to the same objects entities Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying socalled bridging relationships involving referring expressions For example in a sentence such as He entered Johns house through the front door the front door is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of Johns house rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to Discourse analysis This rubric includes several related tasks One task is discourse parsing ie identifying the discourse structure of a connected text ie the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences eg elaboration explanation contrast Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text eg yesno question content question statement assertion etc Implicit semantic role labelling Given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates eg verbal frames and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence see Semantic role labelling above Then identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified and resolve the former against the local text A closely related task is zero anaphora resolution ie the extension of coreference resolution to prodrop languages Recognizing textual entailment Given two text fragments determine if one being true entails the other entails the others negation or allows the other to be either true or false Topic segmentation and recognition Given a chunk of text separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic and identify the topic of the segment Argument mining The goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs Such argumentative structures include the premise conclusions the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument or the main and counterargument within discourse Higherlevel NLP applications Automatic summarization text summarization Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text Often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type such as research papers articles in the financial section of a newspaper Grammatical error correction Grammatical error detection and correction involves a great bandwidth of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis phonologyorthography morphology syntax semantics pragmatics Grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire English as a second language It has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since 2011 As far as orthography morphology syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as GPT this can now 2019 be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications Machine translation MT Automatically translate text from one human language to another This is one of the most difficult problems and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed AIcomplete ie requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess grammar semantics facts about the real world etc to solve properly Naturallanguage understanding NLU Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as firstorder logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closedworld assumption CWA vs openworld assumption or subjective YesNo vs objective TrueFalse is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization Naturallanguage generation NLG Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language Book generation Not an NLP task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other NLP tasks is the creation of fullfledged books The first machinegenerated book was created by a rulebased system in 1984 Racter The policemans beard is halfconstructed The first published work by a neural network was published in 2018 the Road marketed as a novel contains sixty million words Both these systems are basically elaborate but nonsensical semanticsfree language models The first machinegenerated science book was published in 2019 Beta Writer LithiumIon Batteries Springer Cham Unlike Racter and the Road this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization Document AI A Document AI platform sits on top of the NLP technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence machine learning or NLP to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types NLPpowered Document AI enables nontechnical teams to quickly access information hidden in documents for example lawyers business analysts and accountants Dialogue management Computer systems intended to converse with a human Question answering Given a humanlanguage question determine its answer Typical questions have a specific right answer such as What is the capital of Canada but sometimes openended questions are also considered such as What is the meaning of life Texttoimage generation Given a description of an image generate an image that matches the description Texttoscene generation Given a description of a scene generate a D model of the scene Texttovideo Given a description of a video generate a video that matches the description General tendencies and possible future directions Based on longstanding trends in the field it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP As of 2020 three trends among the topics of the longstanding series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed Interest on increasingly abstract cognitive aspects of natural language

supervised towards weakly supervised methods representation learning and endtoend systems Cognition and NLP Most higherlevel NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language More broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above Cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics Especially during the age of symbolic NLP the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies As an example George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing NLP algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics with two defining aspects Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by Lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author For example consider the English word big When used in a comparison That is a big tree the authors intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience When used metaphorically Tomorrow is a big day the authors intent to imply importance The intent behind other usages like in She is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information Assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed eg by means of a probabilistic contextfree grammar PCFG The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in US patent 9269353 displaystyle RMMtoken_NPMMtoken_Ntimes frac dleftsum _iddPMMtoken_Ntimes PFtoken_Ntoken_N_iright Where RMM is the relative measure of meaning token is any block of text sentence phrase or word N is the number of tokens being analyzed PMM is the probable measure of meaning based on a corpora d is the location of the token along the sequence of N tokens PF is the probability function specific to a language Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s Nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks eg of cognitive grammar functional grammar construction grammar computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience eg ACTR however with limited uptake in mainstream NLP as measured by presence on major conferences of the ACL More recently ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability eg under the notion of cognitive AI Likewise ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP although rarely made explicit and developments in artificial intelligence specifically
